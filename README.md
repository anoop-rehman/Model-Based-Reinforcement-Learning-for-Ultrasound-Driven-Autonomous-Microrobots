# Model-Based-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Ultrasound-Driven-Autonomous-Microrobots# Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Ultrasound-Driven Autonomous Microrobots

## Abstract
AI has catalyzed transformative advancements across multiple sectors, from medical diagnostics to autonomous vehicles, enhancing precision and efficiency. As it ventures into microrobotics, AI offers innovative solutions to the formidable challenge of controlling microrobots, which typically operate within imprecise, remotely actuated systems. We implement state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning for autonomous control of an ultrasound-driven microrobot learning from recurrent imagined environments. Our non-invasive, AI-controlled microrobot offers precise propulsion, which efficiently learns from images in data-scarce environments. Transitioning from a pre-trained simulation environment, we achieve sample-efficient collision avoidance and channel navigation, reaching a **90% success rate** in target navigation across various channels within an hour of fine-tuning. Moreover, our model initially successfully generalized in **50% of tasks in new environments**, improving to **over 90% with 30 minutes of further training**. Furthermore, we have showcased real-time manipulation of microrobots within complex vasculatures and across stationary and physiological flows, underscoring AI's potential to revolutionize microrobotics in biomedical applications.

Below are key demonstrations from our research:

### **Movie S1**
Training process of MBRL in a real microfluidic racetrack channel. The left video shows early training (<100k steps) where the algorithm struggles to reach the target. On the right, after 340k steps, the algorithm shows improved target acquisition. The full process spans 10 days due to real-environment interactions.

### **Movie S7**
Active and passive shape-shifting of a microrobot navigating obstacles in a microchannel is demonstrated. Passive deformation occurs when a single piezoelectric transducer (PZT) is activated, while active manipulation involves dynamic shape changes using multiple PZTs for precise control and navigation.
